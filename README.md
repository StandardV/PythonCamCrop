## A little history about why this is made:

  I had played and still playing a game call Pixel Starship, in basic terms, it could be think of as an 8-bit game that are made like a 2d clash of clan version
  
  In the game, there is one auction system that allow players on all over the world trade stuff, set their own price, and if it's a good deal, another player can take it, the price is fixed, and it's built based on a "who is the fastest at snatching things" buying model.
  
  The seller set the price, the buyer buy it, and the system take 20% percent the selling value of the total amount that the seller recieve as seling tax
  
  
  
  #### Expample of how it work:

## Why did I decided to make the script:
 
 With all of that being said, seeing the auction content being distributed horizontally is not the best approach both mentally and physically since it would take a small amount of time for user to look back and fort, make decision between the price and so
 
  ==> Based on the conclusion, I've merged it all into a script that could solve this, display all auctioning information into one block and just press a button to buy instead of good old click and confirm type ( of course, the trade process can be done automatically by one script, you can check out the script OCRpyautogui- https://github.com/StandardV/OCR-with-Pyautogui that I have written)
