## A little history about why this is made:

  I had played and still playing a game call Pixel Starship, in basic terms, it could be think of as an 8-bit game that are made like a 2d clash of clan version
  
  In the game, there is one auction system that allow players on all over the world trade stuff, set their own price, and if it's a good deal, another player can take it, the price is fixed, and it's built based on a "who is the fastest at snatching things" buying model.
  
  The seller set the price, the buyer buy it, and the system take 20% percent the selling value of the total amount that the seller recieve as seling tax
